## Searching for attractors
----

Finding strange attractors worth being rendered is probably the most time consuming activity on Chaoscope, and is also what creating fractal — or chaos based — images is about : looking for the best, unexplored spot.

*"You can compare searching for a strange attractor to digging for gold. Your map is the search domain, or the default limit assigned to all the parameters (the minimum and maximum values of the parameter sliders)."*

*"Pressing the F3 key would be equivalent to throw a dart on the map, blindfolded, drill at the location where the dart landed, until you find a gold deposit. This is what Chaoscope does : each parameter is given a random value within its own range, the equation is then iterated 20,000 times and the resulting attractor is analyzed. If there's no attractor or if it doesn't qualified as chaotic (in our case, fractal dimension greater than 1.5 and positive Lyapunov exponent) then the parameters are randomized again, and the search process carries on until a strange attractor is found or the search is stopped by the user."*

*"This is a "brute force algorithm", only practical because computers are faster at doing math than we are at throwing darts. The downside of this method is nothing says you will hit a huge deposit or find just a single nugget of gold."*
